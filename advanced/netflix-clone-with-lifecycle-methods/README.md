The repository helps you learn lifecycle methods by buiding Netflix. It means that you are learning life cycle methods by building a real-life project. I will explain concepts in detail. This post is the seventh part in my series and it is suitable for beginners.

## __Preface__

This course will help you to learn lifecycle methods by building Netflix. It means that you are learning by doing a real-life project. You will understand about different phases such as mounting, updating and unmounting. 

> If you are using function components, you do not need to care about lifecyle methods. Because from React v16.8, we have supporting from React Hooks. I will have another post to explain about React Hooks by Building Netflix.

## __0. How to Run the Project.__

- Step 1: Clone the project by using git clone or download the zip file.

- Step 2: Open "terminal" / "cmd" / "gitbash" and change directory to "netflix-clone" and run "npm install" to install dependencies.

- Step 3: Run "npm run start" to run the fron-end project.

### __3.3. Materials.__

- Html, css, js (source code) was prepared because I want to focus on React and share knowledge about React. Building html and css from scratch would take a lot of time.

- README.md (the md file will contain everything about the course).

- Netflix data will be used to import to Firebase. In this course, we use Firebase as our back-end service.

<a id="purposes-of-the-course"></a>
## __4. Purposes of the Course.__

<a id="final-project"></a>
### __4.1. Final Project.__

- The course would help you have understanding about React.

- You could build the final project with end-to-end solution (front-end solution using React and back-end solution using Firebase).

<a id="job"></a>
### __4.2. Job.__

- After finishing the course, you could get a job with fresher / junior position.

<a id="react-lifecycle-methods"></a>
## __5. React Lifecycle Methods.__

<a id="what"></a>
### __5.1. What.__

- We have two ways in order to define React's components (class component or function component).

- If we are using class components, we need to understand about different phases in component's lifecycle.

- For this reason, we can know the purpose of each lifecycle's method and write code in the correct places and avoid unexpected behaviour.

<a id="why"></a>
### __5.3. Why__

- We need to find the correc place to write code and avoid issues. 

For example: we should not write code to fetch apis inside the render function. We should write it in the componentDidMount and so on.

<a id="when"></a>
### __5.4. When__

- If you are using class component in your applications, you should have understanding about lifecyle methods.

<a id="how"></a>
### __5.5. How__

- Define your components as class components.

- Write lifecycle methods for different phases of your components

<a id="scenarios"></a>
## 6. Scenarios.

<a id="figure1"></a>

Figure 1. Detail Page - Netflix.

In the previous posts, we defined __Detail__ component as a function component. However, as mentioned above, we can write lifeycle methods if our components are class components. For this reason, we should refactor our __Detail__ component to class component in order to learn about lifecyle methods in React.

Step 1: Update __Home.js__ with the following code.

```js
...
{/* Detail */}
<Detail movie={selectedMovie} onDetailClosed={closeDetail} />
{/* End Detail */}
...
```

> __1st NOTE__:
>
> - In the previous post, we use conditonal rendering in React to show / hide the __Detail__ component based on __selectedMovie__ state. 
>
> - However, in this post, we will let the __Detail__ component be available from the beginning to learn about lifecycle methods.
>
> - We will write the logic to show / hide the UI inside the __Detail__ component.

Step 3: Convert __Detail__ component to class component.

```js
import React from "react";
/**
 * create Detail component
 * @param {*} props which are passed to Detail component.
 */
class Detail extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log("constructor was called");
    this.state = {};
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    console.log("getDerivedStateFromProps was called");
    return state;
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate() {
    console.log("shouldComponentUpdate was called");
    return true;
  }

  render() {
    console.log("render was called");
    const { movie, onDetailClosed } = this.props;

    if (!movie) {
      return null;
    }
    // return detail elements.
    return (
      <div className="detail">
        {/* Detail Banner Image */}
        <div
          className="detail__image"
          style={{
            backgroundImage: `url(https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/${movie?.backdrop_path})`
          }}
        >
          <span className="detail__title">{movie?.original_name}</span>
        </div>
        {/* End Detail Banner Image */}
        {/* Detail Fade Bottom Animation */}
        <div className="banner--fadeBottom detail__fade-image"></div>
        {/* End Detail Fade Bottom Animation */}
        {/* Detail Actions */}
        <div className="detail__actions">
          <button className="detail__btn mgr-8">Play</button>
          <button className="detail__btn" onClick={onDetailClosed}>
            Back
          </button>
        </div>
        <div className="detail__description">
          <div className="detail__description-title">Description</div>
          <p className="detail__description-content">{movie?.overview}</p>
        </div>
        {/* End Detail Actions */}
      </div>
    );
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("componentDidMount was called");
  }

  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    console.log("getSnapshotBeforeUpdate was called");
    return prevState;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log("componentDidUpdate was called");
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("componentWillUnmount was called");
  }
}

export default Detail;
```

If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.

<a id="summary"></a>
## __Summary__

- We have three phases in the lifecycle: __mounting, __updating__, and __unmounting__.

- In the __mounting__ phase, we have __constructor__, __getDerivedStateFromProps__, __render__ and __componentDidUpdate__.

- The __updating__ phase will contain __getDerivedStateFromProps__, __shouldComponentUpdate__, __render__, __getSnapshowBeforeUpdate__, __componentDidUpdate__.

- The __unmounting__ phase will contain __componentWillUnmount__.

Thank you so much for taking the course. I hope that you could understand about React lifecycle methods and you can build many real-life projects by using React (as front-end) and Firebase (as back-end) in order to solve many problems and make our life become better.
