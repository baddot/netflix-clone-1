## __5. Redux Middleware__

- It provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.

<a id="what-is-redux-saga"></a>
### __5.1. What is Redux Saga__

- redux-saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.

- The mental model is that a saga is like a separate thread in your application that's solely responsible for side effects. redux-saga is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal redux actions, it has access to the full redux application state and it can dispatch redux actions as well.

<a id="the-architecture-of-redux-middleware"></a>
### __5.2. The Architecture of Redux Middlware__

<a id="figure1"></a>
<img src="../../md-images/redux-middleware.gif" alt="redux-middleware-architecture" width="666"/>

Figure 1. Redux Middleware - Architecture.

<a id="why"></a>
### __5.3. Why__

- With a plain basic Redux store, you can only do simple synchronous updates by dispatching an action. Middleware extends the store's abilities, and lets you write async logic that interacts with the store.

- Redux-saga are the recommended middleware for basic Redux side effects logic, including complex synchronous logic that needs access to the store, and simple async logic like AJAX requests.

<a id="when"></a>
### __5.4. When__

- You can do synchronous updates by dispatching an action. In some cases, you need to perform asynchronous actions. It is time to use Redux Middleware. 

<a id="how"></a>
### __5.5. How__

Firstly, we need to understand the flow first. 

- The components will get state from the store. Whenever the state is changed, the components will be re-rendered.

- The components will dispatch actions to tell the reducers update the state in the store.

- In the case, we want to dispatch some asynchronous actions. The middleware will perform some side effects and get then pass the result to the reducers. 

- The reducers will take the responsibility to update the state. It will be used to return the latest state. In fact, we will not dispatch actions in the reducers. It is an anti-patten, we should avoid that.

In order to integrate Redux Saga in our Netflix application, please follow the below steps: 

- Step 1: define the actions including the actions and the action's types. 

- Step 2: define the reducers.

- Step 3: define the store.

- Step 4: Import redux-saga and apply middleware to the store.

- Step 5: Use the store in our application.

- Step 6: Let our components get the state from the store.

- Step 7: Let our components dispatch the actions to the store.

<a id="build-login-feature-by-using-redux-and-redux-saga-netflix"></a>
## 6. Build Login Feature by Using Redux and Redux Saga - Netflix.

<a id="figure2"></a>
<img src="../../md-images/netflix-login1.png" alt="reduc-middleware-architecture" width="666"/>

Figure 2. Login Page - Netflix.

In the first part of the series, we built the login feature by using pure React. In this part, we will refactor the code and re-build the login feature with supporting from Redux-Saga.

- Step 1: Install the Redux-Saga by running __npm install redux-saga__ or __yarn add redux-saga__

- Step 2: Create __services__ folder. The folder will be used to contain files which interact with the back-end.

- Step 3: Create __LoginService.js__ file in __services__ folder. __LoginService__ is used to perform auth feature.

```js
// import firebase authentication.
import { firebaseAuth } from "../firebase/firebase";

export const login = (email, password) => {
  return firebaseAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
};
```

- Step 4: Create __LoginActionTypes.js__ in __actions__ folder. The file will specify action's types for the login reducer such as login action, etc.

```js
export const LOGIN = "LOGIN";
```

- Step 5: Create __sagas__ folder. The folder will be used to store different sagas in the application.

- Step 6: Create __LoginSaga.js__ inside __sagas__ folder.

```js
// import redux saga.
import { call, put, takeLatest } from "redux-saga/effects";
// import action types.
import * as loadingActionTypes from "../actions/LoadingActionTypes";
import * as loginActionTypes from "../actions/LoginActionTypes";
// import login service.
import * as loginService from "../services/LoginService";

function* login(action) {
  try {
    // show loading indicator.
    yield put({ type: loadingActionTypes.SHOW_LOADING });
    // call login service.
    const userCredentials = yield call(
      loginService.login,
      action.payload.email,
      action.payload.password
    );
    if (userCredentials != null) {
      console.log("Signed in user: ");
      console.log(userCredentials);
    }
    // hide loading indicator.
    yield put({ type: loadingActionTypes.HIDE_LOADING });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

function* loginSaga() {
  yield takeLatest(loginActionTypes.LOGIN, login);
}

export default loginSaga;
```

> __1st NOTE__:
>
> - In saga file, we define functions as generator functions.
>
> - Each saga function will be associated with an action. For this reason, the function accepts __action__ as parameter. 
>
> - __put__ is used to dispatch other actions in redux-saga. In this case, we dispatch __SHOW_LOADING__ ans __HIDE_LOADING__ actions.
>
> - __call(fn, ...args)__ creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to call the function fn with args as arguments.
>
> - As mentioned before, each saga function should be associated with an action. We associate the __login__ function with __loginActionTypes.LOGIN__ action.
>
> - __takeLatest__ gets the response of the latest request that was fired
>

- Step 7: In fact, we could have many sagas in our application. The best practice is to combine all sagas into a root saga. Create __index.js__ file in __sagas__ folder. The __index.js__ file is used to combine all sagas.

```js
// import redux saga.
import { all } from "redux-saga/effects";
// import sagas.
import loginSaga from "./LoginSaga";

function* rootSaga() {
  yield all([loginSaga()]);
}

export default rootSaga;
```

> __2nd NOTE__:
>
> - __all__: is used to execute different sagas in parallel.
>
> - We are importing different sagas from different files and combine them into a single root saga.
>

- Step 8: Update __store.js__ with the following code.

```js
// import create store
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
// import root reducer.
import reducer from "./reducers";
// import redux saga.
import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga';
// import root saga.
import rootSaga from './sagas';

const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware));

sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);

export default store;
```

> __3rd NOTE__:
>
> - __applyMiddleware__: is used to apply middleware to the store. 
>
> - __createSagaMiddleware__: is used to define saga middleware.
>
> - We need to import the root saga and it will be the parameter of __sagaMiddleware.run__ function.

- Step 9: In __LoginForm.js__, we should perform auth feature by dispatching the login action.

```js
// import react.
import { useState } from "react";
// import useDispatch to dispach an action to the store.
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
// import action tyoes.
import * as loginActionTypes from "../../actions/LoginActionTypes";

/**
 * create LoginForm component.
 */
function LoginForm() {
  // create email and password state to store user's credentials.
  const [email, setEmail] = useState();
  const [password, setPassword] = useState();
  // create dispatch object to dispatch an action to the store.
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  /**
   * handle event when the user clicks on "Login" button.
   */
  const login = () => {
    // call firebase authentication service.
    dispatch({ type: loginActionTypes.LOGIN, payload: { email, password } });
  };

  /**
   * update email state when the user inputs the email field.
   * @param {*} e - synthetic event to get the latest email's value.
   */
  const onEmailChanged = (e) => {
    // get email value.
    const updatedEmail = e.target.value;
    // update email state.
    setEmail(() => updatedEmail);
  };

  /**
   * update password state when the user input the password field.
   * @param {*} e - synthetic event to get the latest password's value.
   */
  const onPasswordChanged = (e) => {
    // get password value.
    const updatedPassword = e.target.value;
    // update password state.
    setPassword(() => updatedPassword);
  };

  return (
    <div className="login-body">
      <div className="login-body__form">
        <h1>Sign In</h1>
        <div className="login-body__input mb-16">
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder="Email or phone number"
            onChange={onEmailChanged}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="login-body__input">
          <input
            type="password"
            placeholder="Password"
            onChange={onPasswordChanged}
          />
        </div>
        <button className="login-body__submit-btn" onClick={login}>
          Sign In
        </button>
        <div className="login-body__options">

## __Summary__

- You can do synchronous updates by dispatching an action. In some cases, you need to perform asynchronous actions. It is time to use Redux Middleware. 

- Redux-saga are the recommended middleware for basic Redux side effects logic, including complex synchronous logic that needs access to the store, and simple async logic like AJAX requests.

- __applyMiddleware__ is used to apply middleware to the store. 

- In fact, we can apply multiple middlewares.

Thank you so much for taking the course. I hope that you could understand about Redux and you can build many real-life projects by using React (as front-end) and Firebase (as back-end) in order to solve many problems and make our life become better.
