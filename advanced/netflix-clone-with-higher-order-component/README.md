- README.md (the md file will contain everything about the course).

- Netflix data will be used to import to Firebase. In this course, we use Firebase as our back-end service.

<a id="purposes-of-the-course"></a>
## __4. Purposes of the Course.__

<a id="final-project"></a>
### __4.1. Final Project.__

- The course would help you have understanding about React.

- You could build the final project with end-to-end solution (front-end solution using React and back-end solution using Firebase).

<a id="job"></a>
### __4.2. Job.__

- After finishing the course, you could get a job with fresher / junior position.

<a id="higher-order-components"></a>
## __5. Higher Order Components.__

<a id="higher-order-functions"></a>
### __5.1. Higher Order Functions.__

- Higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.

```js
const firstOrderFunc = () => console.log ('Hello, I am a First order function');
const higherOrder = ReturnFirstOrderFunc => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();
higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);
```
<a id="what-is-redux-thunk"></a>
### __5.2. What__

- Higher-order component is a function that take a component as input and return a new component.
- It is called a pure function because it will not modify or copy any behaviour from its input component.

<a id="the-architecture-of-redux-middleware"></a>
### __5.3. Why__

There are some advangtages of higher-order components:
- Code reuse, logic and boostrap abstraction.
- Render hijacking.
- State abstraction and manipualtion.
- Props manipulation.

<a id="when"></a>
### __5.4. When__

- In the case, we want to reuse code between component. We should use higher-order components. 

Example: We often use modal UI  in our applications. The modal UI is the same among the screens. The logic of turning on / off the modal may be dupplicated in different places. For this reason, we should find a good solution which helps us reuse the same logic. Higher-order components could be a good solution to hanlde that case.

<a id="how"></a>
### __5.5. How__

- Step 1: Create a function that accept another function as parameter. 

- Step 2: Add custom behaviour (state, styling, logic and so on).

- Step 3: Return a new component.

<a id="scenarios"></a>
## 6. Scenarios.

<a id="figure1"></a>
<img src="../../md-images/netflix-login1.png" alt="reduc-middleware-architecture" width="666"/>

Figure 1. Login Page - Netflix.

We built the login page in the first parr of this series. However, we do not validate input email and password. Our scenarios will be like this:

- Case 1: If user input invalid email or password, a modal will be displayed in order to show the error message.

- Case 2: If user input input valid email and password. We will show the information if signed in user on the console.

As mentioned above, we need to diplay the error message by using a modal. Actually, we have several ways to achive the result. However, the optimal solution should be found and that solution should help us to reuse the logic of turning on / off the modal because we need to use the modal in different places such as "sign-up" feature, ... 

We will build the idea by applying higher-order components. 

- Step 1: Install validator library to validate the input values by running __npm install validator__ or __yarn add validator__.

- Step 2: Write a function to validate the input values.

```js
...
// import validator.
import validator from "validator";
...
...
const isUserCredentialsValid = () => {
  return validator.isEmail(email) && validator.isLength(password, { min: 6 });
};
...
```

> __1st NOTE__: 
>
> - We are using __validator__ libary in order to help us validate some common information such as email format, length of the values and so on. For this reason, we do not need to write everything from scratch. 
>
> - In this case, we want to validate the email format and the minimum length of the password should by 6 characters.

- Step 2: Update the __login__ function:

```js
/**
 * handle event when the user clicks on "Login" button.
 */
const login = () => {
  if (isUserCredentialsValid()) {
    // call firebase authentication service.
    firebaseAuth
      .signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
      .then((userCredential) => {
        // Signed in
        const user = userCredential.user;
        // ...
        console.log(`signed in user`);
        console.log(user);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  } else {
    // call function to show the modal.
  }
};
```

> __2nd NOTE__:
>
> - We use __isUserCredentialsValid()__ inside the __login__ function. We want to ensure that the input values are valid before submitting to Firebase. 
>
> - If the input values are not valid, we will show the modal to display the error message. We will comeback to it later.

- Step 3: Create __modal__ folder inside __components__ folder. The folder is used to contain __Modal__ component.

- Step 4: Create __Modal.js__ file inside __modal__ folder.

```js
const withModal = (WrapperComponent) => {
  const showModal = ({ message }) => {
    window.alert(message);
  };

  return function () {
    return <WrapperComponent showModal={showModal} />;
  };
};
export default withModal;

```

> __3rd NOTE__
>
> - We define __withModal__ as a higher-order component because it accept __WrapperComponent__ as parameter and then return a new component. 
>
> - As mentioned above, we use higher-order components to reuse logic and share the code between components. In this case, we reuse the logic of turning on / off the modal. In fact, the modal could be understood as a common component because, it is used frequently in different places.
>
> - We define __showModal__ function that accept an object with the message property as parameter. We are use the default alert of window object instead of creating the new one because we want to focus on learning about higher-order components, you can custom you own modal.
> 
> - The most important part is about 
>
> ```js
> <WrapperComponent showModal={showModal} />
>```
>
> - We accept __WrapperComponent__ as input and after adding custom behaviour, we return a new component and pass __showModal__ function as props. The returned component is called __EnhancedComponent__.
>

- Step 5: Replace the __LoginForm.js__ with the following code: 

```js
// import react.
import { useState } from "react";
// import firebase authentication.
import { firebaseAuth } from "../../firebase/firebase";
// import higher order components.
import withModal from "../modal/Modal";
// import validator.
import validator from "validator";
/**
 * create LoginForm component.
 */
function LoginForm(props) {
  // create email and password state to store user's credentials.
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

  const { showModal } = props;

  const isUserCredentialsValid = () => {
    return validator.isEmail(email) && validator.isLength(password, { min: 6 });
  };

  /**
   * handle event when the user clicks on "Login" button.
   */
  const login = () => {
    if (isUserCredentialsValid()) {
      // call firebase authentication service.
      firebaseAuth
        .signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
        .then((userCredential) => {
          // Signed in
          const user = userCredential.user;
          // ...
          console.log(`signed in user`);
          console.log(user);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.log(error);
        });
    } else {
      showModal({ message: "Your email and password are not correct" });
    }
  };

  /**
   * update email state when the user inputs the email field.
   * @param {*} e - synthetic event to get the latest email's value.
   */
  const onEmailChanged = (e) => {
    // get email value.
    const updatedEmail = e.target.value;
    // update email state.
    setEmail(() => updatedEmail);
  };

  /**
   * update password state when the user input the password field.
   * @param {*} e - synthetic event to get the latest password's value.
   */
  const onPasswordChanged = (e) => {
    // get password value.
    const updatedPassword = e.target.value;
    // update password state.
    setPassword(() => updatedPassword);
  };

  return (
    <div className="login-body">

## __Summary__

- Higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

- It is a pure function because it will not modify or copy any behaviour from its input component.

- Higher-order components have many advantages such as code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction, state abstraction and manipulation, props manipulation and so on.

Thank you so much for taking the course. I hope that you could understand about Higher Order Components and you can build many real-life projects by using React (as front-end) and Firebase (as back-end) in order to solve many problems and make our life become better.
